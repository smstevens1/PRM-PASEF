# PRM-PASEF

This python script requires two input files: 
1) The gene target list in .txt format: It can be exported from IPA. It can also be a user-generated file, and must have at least one column named "Symbol" that has gene names.
2) DIA output in .tsv format either from DIA-NN (v. 1.8.1) or TIMS DIA-NN.

To run the script, 
- the user must have python3 installed along with Pandas and Numpy libraries.
- use command $my_python $path/PRM_script.py, where $my_python refers to python3 vesion and $path is the directory in which PRM_script.py is stored.

Once executed, the user will be asked several prompts (description below).
1) Enter name of IPA file (txt format):
Specify the gene input list (include .txt extension) and ensure appropriate format (example IPA input is provided).
The script identifies just the gene name under then Symbol column header, so only this is needed when generating a user-defined target list.
2) Enter name of MS file (tsv format):
Specify the DIA output file from either DIA-NN or TIMS DIA-NN (include .tsv extension).
3) Enter MS file type (TIMSDIANN/DIANN):
Specify if this output file was generated from TIMSDIANN or DIANN.
4) Enter name of output file (csv format):
Name your output file (include .csv extension)
5) Enter RT range (seconds): [Suggested:240]
Specify the retention time range window for the precursor ions (our suggested is 4 min but could change based on your experiments).
6) Enter IM tolerance (percent): [Suggested:4]
Specify the ion mobility measurement tolerance (our suggested window is 4% of the measured IM value from the DIA output).
7) Enter charge-state relative intensity tolerance (fraction): [Suggested:0.2]
In the case of a precursor ion with multiple charge states, only the predominant charge state will be selected if the lower 
abundance charge state is below 0.2 relative to other charge state. If this criterion is not met, both charge states are kept.
8) Enter undigested sequence relative intensity tolerance (fraction): [Suggested:0.1]
In the case of a peptide with missed cleavages, the missed cleaved peptide will be dropped if below this intensity tolerance. If
the missed cleavage is higher abundance, both peptides will be dropped.
9) Enter a positive integer to print only the top N highest intensity sequences. (Enter -1 for all sequences):
Precursors can be limited to a certain number based on intensity (e.g., 2 would indicate to only include the top 2 most intense 
peptide precursors). If -1 is entered, then all peptides will be included without intensity filtering.
10) Drop sequences contaning Methionine (YES/NO):
If yes, then all methionine-containing sequences will be dropped from the PRM list.

The .csv file can be directly imported into Bruker Compass HyStar for PRM-PASEF method generation.
